# TransformEw2 Study Resources

This folder contains comprehensive resources for studying the TransformEw2 model implementation and understanding its improvements over TransformEw1.

## Folder Structure

- **Code/**: Contains the model implementation files
  - `model.py`: The original TransformEw2 model implementation
  - `model_annotated.py`: Heavily commented version with explanations
  - `inference.py`: Script for running inference with the model

- **Documentation/**: Contains explanatory documents
  - `transformew_comparison.md`: Detailed comparison between TransformEw1 and TransformEw2
  - `transformew2_study_guide.md`: Step-by-step guide for studying the code
  - `transformew2_cheatsheet.md`: Quick reference for key components and improvements
  - `transformew2_architecture.txt`: Text-based diagram of the architecture

- **References/**: For additional papers and resources (add your own)
  - Recommended: "Attention Is All You Need" paper
  - Recommended: "On Layer Normalization in the Transformer Architecture"
  - Recommended: "Understanding the Difficulty of Training Transformers"

- **Examples/**: For code examples from other implementations (add your own)
  - Recommended: The Annotated Transformer (Harvard NLP)
  - Recommended: Hugging Face Transformers examples
  - Recommended: PyTorch's nn.Transformer examples

## Getting Started

1. Begin with `Documentation/transformew_comparison.md` to understand the key differences
2. Study `Code/model_annotated.py` to understand the implementation details
3. Follow the structured approach in `Documentation/transformew2_study_guide.md`
4. Use `Documentation/transformew2_cheatsheet.md` for quick reference
5. Refer to `Documentation/transformew2_architecture.txt` to visualize the model structure

## Additional Resources to Consider Adding

### Papers
- "Attention Is All You Need" (Vaswani et al., 2017)
- "On Layer Normalization in the Transformer Architecture" (Xiong et al., 2020)
- "Understanding the Difficulty of Training Transformers" (Liu et al., 2020)

### Books
- "Natural Language Processing with Transformers" by Lewis Tunstall et al.
- "Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing" by Yoav Goldberg
- "Speech and Language Processing" by Dan Jurafsky and James H. Martin

### Online Resources
- The Annotated Transformer: http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html
- Hugging Face Transformers documentation
- PyTorch documentation

## Study Tips

1. Focus on understanding one component at a time
2. Compare the TransformEw2 implementation with other implementations
3. Take notes on the key differences and improvements
4. Create your own diagrams to visualize the architecture
5. Experiment with the code to see how changes affect performance

Happy studying!
