# V1 Transformer Implementation: Analysis and Improvements

This document outlines the implementation details of our V1 transformer architecture for Ewe-English translation, identifies key issues, and describes improvements planned for V2.

## V1 Transformer Implementation

The V1 transformer implementation followed the standard architecture from "Attention Is All You Need" with the following specifications:

- **Architecture**: 6-layer encoder-decoder with 8 attention heads
- **Dimensions**: 512 embedding dimension, 2048 feed-forward dimension
- **Vocabulary**: 8000 tokens for both Ewe and English using SentencePiece tokenization
- **Training**: Adam optimizer with custom learning rate schedule and label smoothing

### Key Components

1. **Tokenization**: SentencePiece tokenizers trained separately for Ewe and English
2. **Data Processing**: Basic cleaning, length filtering, and alignment verification
3. **Model**: Standard transformer with multi-head attention and position-wise feed-forward networks
4. **Training**: Batch size of 32, early stopping based on validation loss

## Issues in V1 Implementation

### 1. Data Processing Limitations

- **No stopword handling**: The V1 implementation lacked language-specific stopword handling for Ewe and English
- **Limited text normalization**: Unicode normalization was basic and didn't account for Ewe-specific characters
- **Insufficient data cleaning**: Duplicate removal and filtering were present but not optimized for low-resource scenarios

### 2. Tokenization Challenges

- **Fixed vocabulary size**: The 8000 token vocabulary was applied uniformly without language-specific optimization
- **Limited subword handling**: SentencePiece was used but not optimized for morphologically rich Ewe language
- **No special token handling**: Cultural and context-specific tokens weren't given special treatment

### 3. Model Architecture Issues

- **Dimension mismatch**: Output dimension (512) didn't match target vocabulary size (8000), requiring fixes
- **Standard architecture limitations**: The vanilla transformer architecture wasn't adapted for low-resource translation
- **Attention mechanism**: Standard attention didn't account for linguistic differences between Ewe and English

### 4. Training and Inference Problems

- **Empty translations**: The model frequently produced empty outputs for common phrases
- **Repetitive patterns**: Translations often contained repetitive elements
- **Limited fluency**: Outputs lacked natural flow and grammatical correctness

## V2 Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Data Processing

- **Stoplist Generator**: Implementing language-specific stopword handling for both Ewe and English
- **Advanced text normalization**: Better handling of Ewe-specific characters and diacritics
- **Improved cleaning pipeline**: More sophisticated duplicate detection and filtering

### 2. Tokenization Enhancements

- **Optimized vocabulary sizes**: Language-specific vocabulary sizing based on morphological complexity
- **Improved subword segmentation**: Better handling of Ewe morphology
- **Cultural token preservation**: Special handling for cultural and context-specific tokens

### 3. Model Architecture Refinements

- **Fixed dimension handling**: Proper output dimension configuration to match vocabulary size
- **Low-resource adaptations**: Architecture modifications for better performance with limited data
- **Attention mechanism improvements**: Customized attention patterns for Ewe-English language pair

### 4. Training and Inference Optimization

- **Better initialization**: Improved parameter initialization for faster convergence
- **Enhanced decoding**: More sophisticated beam search and sampling strategies
- **Evaluation metrics**: More comprehensive evaluation beyond BLEU scores

## Stoplist Generator Implementation

The V2 implementation includes a dedicated stoplist generator with:

1. **Regex-based filtering**: Pattern-based identification of function words in both languages
2. **Frequency-based analysis**: Statistical identification of high-frequency, low-information words
3. **Language-specific rules**: Custom rules for Ewe that account for its linguistic properties
4. **Integration with preprocessing**: Seamless incorporation into the data cleaning pipeline

This stoplist approach helps the model focus on meaningful content words rather than function words, potentially improving translation quality for this low-resource language pair.
